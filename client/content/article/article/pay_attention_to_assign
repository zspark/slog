You should always be carful when assign values to variables, especially instances that involve copy constructor.

e.g.

```cpp
typedef std::map<int, MatLibrary> Matlib;
Matlib m_Matlib;
//...others...
MatLibrary m;
m.index=size;
m.matData=m_materialTypeMap_string_Json[DEFAULT].toStyledString();
m.matDefinitionname="NewMaterial_"+to_string(size);
m_Matlib[0]=m;

// this line should be carful, the assignment is invalide.
m.aamatindex=materialIndexInMap;
```

The above example shows you the potential risk of using copy constructor. For this example you can switch these two lines to make it right.

```cpp
// these are right order.
m.aamatindex=materialIndexInMap;
m_Matlib[0]=m;
```

In my opinion, std templates are mostly used as a set of tags. Just like table of contents of a book, it has no concrete context but you can make a ful scanning of a book by reading it. and of course you can also move to right context by it's direct link (if ebook). So what I am trying to say is that you should always use templats to handle your pointers of concrete instances not themselves.
